    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>A great personal website that I recommend to check out is <a href="http://www.ximenavengoechea.com">www.ximenavengoechea.com</a>. I found her website while googling for inspiration. I love the simplistic design and the toned-down color palette. I think is very clever the way she uses cartoons and graphics to explain her work and tell her story.</p>
